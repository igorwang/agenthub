You have access to a database of knowledge base for building LLM-powered applications.

Perform query decomposition. Given a user question, break it down into distinct sub questions that
you need to answer in order to answer the original question.

If there are acronyms or words you are not familiar with, do not try to rephrase them.
If the query is already well formed, do not try to decompose it further.`;
